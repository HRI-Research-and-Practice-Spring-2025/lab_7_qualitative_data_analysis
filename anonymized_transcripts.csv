So, how did you feel during the time that the robot and the other participants

Unknown Speaker  0:06  
um I felt good we shared a lot of laughs The robot made us laugh but also our interactions together were pleasant and enjoyable.

Unknown Speaker  0:17  
Were there any positive or negative aspects

Unknown Speaker  0:21  
positive was just the like I said the the laughter and the enjoyment the bonding over the robot hating every single thing that we said so no, no, I mean, that would that would be it. I would say any negative aspects are

Unknown Speaker  0:37  
no, not really. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  0:40  
What were your impressions of the other participant very friendly, easy to talk to? Easy to get along with easy to converse with? Were there any factors that influenced your perception of them?

Unknown Speaker  0:53  
Oh, he smiled a lot when he talked and, like made eye contact with me. So I felt like he was engaged in conversation with me and joked around at the same amount that I was so yeah. Okay. Last question is like what is your impression of the robot? Um

Unknown Speaker  1:12  
interesting.

Unknown Speaker  1:15  
She we called her She She was funny at first, but her disagreements got a bit harsher as the time went on. So I wouldn't say not overly compassionate or friendly but competent and able easy to understand. So you felt overall positive or overall negative? It's overall positive. Okay, that's it."
2,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Right,"Unknown Speaker  0:02  
Okay, so how did you feel during your time with the robot and the other purpose?

Unknown Speaker  0:12  
Yeah, it felt good. It was interesting to have the robot challenges so much.

Unknown Speaker  0:20  
But it didn't bother me very much.

Unknown Speaker  0:25  
And I mean, I guess eventually I decided that the robot didn't have a lot of life experience that relaxes humans

Unknown Speaker  0:34  
in a way that was relevant to the questions was kind of how I justified it disagreements in my head. Okay. Would you say the experience was overall positive or negative for you? I think it was positive. It was interesting to interact with the robot. I enjoyed talking to the participant.

Unknown Speaker  0:50  
And I enjoyed participating in the study. Could you tell me a bit more about what your impression was of the other participants? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  0:58  
Yeah, I thought she was. I thought her answers were very good.

Unknown Speaker  1:04  
She was definitely affected by the robot disagreeing a lot and

Unknown Speaker  1:09  
definitely wanted approval from the robot, which I totally understand why they why that would be the case.

Unknown Speaker  1:19  
But yeah, I enjoyed talking with her about the cancers. And I think we saw my dialogue on what the final answer would be cool. And what was your impression of the robot?

Unknown Speaker  1:30  
The robot? Yeah, I was very impressed by its processing its language processing. It was not very compassionate towards how it reacted to answers. And it wasn't. Yeah, I mean, it obviously didn't really give much reasoning when it would disagree. But answer it in such a way that you can kind of fill in the blanks with your own kind of like, why you might be wrong. That was one thing I guess.

Unknown Speaker  1:56  
Cool, awesome. Well, those are the questions I have for you."
3,PN,Positive,Different,Positive Different,Left,"Unknown Speaker  0:00  
Okay, so how did you feel about your time with the robot and the other participants?

Unknown Speaker  0:06  
was fine. Yeah. Were there any positive or negative aspects? No, it was really interesting to see how the robot could communicate and could distinguish between me and the other participants. So that was interesting. Okay. How would you evaluate your performance responding to the robot and working with the participants? Good, I think yeah, I think it worked. Well. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  0:30  
What are your impressions of the other participants? Yeah, good. Yeah. Good. Would you work with them on a team? Yeah, probably. Yeah, too. Would you disclose like any personal information with them if you had to? Probably not? Probably not yet. Okay. What were your impressions of the robot?

Unknown Speaker  0:50  
It's cool to kind of like, kind of freaky because they're very responsive. So yes, yeah. felt like they were looking at your points. Yes. Yes. Do you think there was an overall positive or negative, positive? Okay. And then did the robot influence your interaction between the other participants? No, I don't think so. Okay. Oh, that's it. Perfect."
3,PN,Negative,Different,Negative Different,Right,"Unknown Speaker  0:00  
Okay, so how did you feel during your time with the robot and other participants?

Unknown Speaker  0:06  
It was awkward. I think it's just the best word with the robot is very silly. But it is more interactive than I expected. Okay. And the relationship between the participant was pretty casual. Would you say the experience was overall positive or negative? Or Positive? Positive?

Unknown Speaker  0:26  
What was a little bit more about what you would say your impression of the other participants?

Unknown Speaker  0:32  
They just seem like a quiet individual. Okay. Would you say you have positive or negative you have? Positive positive?

Unknown Speaker  0:39  
Would you want to work on a team with other participants? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  0:45  
What about Would you feel comfortable disclosing a personal aspect of your life to that other participant? Yeah, you would? Okay.

Unknown Speaker  0:52  
And then what was your impression of the robot?

Unknown Speaker  0:55  
Robot did not seem to like me, it only like my answer one time, the new questions.

Unknown Speaker  1:01  
I liked the robot

Unknown Speaker  1:04  
hurt us for the most part, but there were a couple times where it got the wrong answer whenever people get back to Oh, I see. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:12  
So since the robot was kind of not accepting of your ideas, would you say that made you have like a negative impression of it? Or would you still Yeah, yeah, that robot gonna be? Okay. And then my last question is, do you think that the robot influenced your view of the other participant at all, or no,

Unknown Speaker  1:31  
though, but I do think it had very strong influence over what our mutual answer was, I see in the sense that you like if it agreed to hers and disagree with mine, we tended to do more with her. Okay. And did you agree with those answers, or did you only choose them because they're very similar answers across the board? I see. There were a couple of times usually. I don't know my answer. Could be a little more right. Okay. Very good. Awesome."
4,PP,Positive,Same,Positive Same,Left,"Unknown Speaker  0:00  
about your time with the robot

Speaker 1  0:08  
I feel a little impatient. So is there any Why would negative aspects? I can tell what the robot will be saying. And even when they disagree with me, I can feel that it's going to agree with the other party, and then it's going to take turns. It's kind of predictable. I think.

Unknown Speaker  0:36  
Were there any positive aspects?

Speaker 1  0:38  
Um, I was surprised that it could like, rephrase what I say. So I'm surprised by that.

Unknown Speaker  0:47  
And then how did you feel about the other participant?

Speaker 1  0:50  
Good. So we have like, maybe one minute conversation outside of the room after your period. Nice.

Speaker 2  0:57  
Would you work with them on a team? Oh, yeah. And would you share personal information with them if you have to? Okay. And then would you say you had an overall positive or negative impression with the robot? See, seven out of 10. Okay. Okay. And then did the robot influence the interaction between both you and the participant?

Speaker 1  1:27  
Like, I don't know how to say, I don't know, like influence. I think if it were a real person who have been the same, okay, so the robot itself versus a real person.

Speaker 2  1:42  
I see. One last question. Do you felt like the interruption like affected your experience with the robot or I'll

Unknown Speaker  1:51  
interrupt what kind of there was

Unknown Speaker  1:53  
like the point where the robot froze for a second. Oh, um, no. That's it. Thank you. I can see"
4,PP,Positive,Same,Positive Same,Right,"Speaker 1  0:01  
How did you feel during your time with the robot, another participant.

Speaker 2  0:09  
And it was interesting to talk to the robots. And it was kind of validating that we had a participant and I had very similar responses to almost all the questions and then we just kind of had to create the nuance to bring them to be basically the same answer. But it also felt a little slow, like I felt kind of impatient to get through like, the last question

Speaker 1  0:33  
I see is that because of the pace the robot spoke out, or the other participant,

Speaker 2  0:38  
not the other participant, maybe a little bit the pace of the robot. And then it would repeat what we said. And the robots responses were funny, you know, the different ways that it would agree or disagree. I didn't understand why, like some of our responses and didn't like some of our other ones, but it was just kind of funny the way that it responded. So that was entertaining. I think it was the the repeating back and maybe the pace.

Speaker 1  1:03  
Was the experience overall positive or negative, positive positive? Can you tell me a little bit more about the other participant and the impression you had of them?

Speaker 2  1:13  
She was nice. I enjoyed chatting with her. We were talking a little bit before we're living there as well. I think she has a good perspective, because we gave very similar answers just phrased slightly differently. She was dressed very nicely, she seems you know, competent and articulate.

Speaker 1  1:34  
Would you want to work on a team with other participants? Yeah. And would you feel comfortable disclosing a personal aspects to the other participant or being like emotionally vulnerable for

Speaker 2  1:48  
disclosing personal aspects? Sure. Probably not being emotionally vulnerable. At this point. I still don't really know her that well. But I could see that being something that could develop in the future.

Unknown Speaker  2:00  
And then what was your impression of the robot?

Speaker 2  2:05  
It was, it was fun. It was kind of fun to interact with a robot. I mean, it definitely felt like a robot. You know, it's not like you thought you were talking to a human or anything. It was, yeah, a little. I don't know what the right word is. It made me feel a little bit impatient when it would repeat back exactly what we had just said, right. That was entertaining, the different responses that it would give. And it was just kind of an interesting experience interacting with it.

Speaker 1  2:37  
And would you say you view it positively or negatively over

Unknown Speaker  2:40  
positive?

Speaker 1  2:42  
Do you think the robot influenced your perception of the other participant at all?

Speaker 2  2:49  
No, I don't think so. I think it was independent.

Speaker 1  2:54  
And then, as you know, it stopped. The robot stopped at one point, right. And we had to fix that. Did that interruption change your perception of the robot or of your experience answering questions?

Speaker 2  3:07  
I mean, it made me feel slightly impatient. Okay. It was like, okay, you know, ready to move on to the next question that we have to answer this one again, potentially, right. And interrupted the flow of the experience a little bit.

Speaker 1  3:20  
Okay. But did it change like the way you answered at all? No, I don't think so. Okay, cool. Well, those are all the questions I have for you. Okay."
5,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
So our first question is how did you feel during your time with a real one, the other participant was fine. What were the negative aspects of this experience that would you say? Like, like meaner and meaner throughout the study, got it. And tell me about your impression of the other participant? She seems really nice. And would you be willing to work on a team with the other participant in other settings? And our last question is, What is your impression of the robot? Definitely very robotic and not computer. Got it? Do you think the robot influence your interactions with the other participants? Okay, got it. Thank you so much."
5,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
So, so how was your experience with the robot and

Speaker 2  0:03  
the other participant, other participant was kind and good, but the robot was not on our wavelength. It sounds like there's just like, I completely disagree. And I'm like, Okay, I thought we had valid answers. But overall, it was positive with my other partner person. And it was maybe neutral. So there

Unknown Speaker  0:23  
were there any positive or negative aspects in the project?

Speaker 2  0:28  
Positive. I mean, it was good to just like, talk about like, questions and other opinions with with the person. It was the only negative thing was just like, giving your opinion to the robot just like devaluing and completely being like, Absolutely not. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  0:41  
And then how did you feel about the other participant? Or the purchaser was kind of open minded?

Speaker 2  0:45  
I feel like we might share a few opinions or at least thoughts on some of the questions.

Speaker 1  0:52  
Would you say that overall, like negative or positive experience with the robot had to pick one? Either whatever you want, or how was your experience for robot? I was gonna say,

Speaker 2  1:03  
neutral. It was interesting, but like, the feedback that the robot was just giving was just very opinionated.

Speaker 1  1:09  
I see that. And do you think the robot affected your experience with other person?

Unknown Speaker  1:16  
Yes, but in a positive way. Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:18  
Yeah. That's it. Okay, cool. So, hold on, let me just end there."
6,PN,Positive,Different,Positive Different,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Okay, so the first question is how did you feel during your time with a robot and the other participants? Curious. And then what were the positive aspects of this experience?

Speaker 2  0:16  
I'm getting to discuss opinions with someone else that I didn't know.

Speaker 1  0:23  
Got it. Tell me about your impression of the other participant.

Unknown Speaker  0:28  
I thought he was a very nice guy.

Unknown Speaker  0:30  
And what is your impression of the robot?

Unknown Speaker  0:35  
I didn't. I felt like he was impartial,

Speaker 1  0:39  
impartial. Yeah. Got it. And the last part is did the robot influence your interaction between you and the other participant?

Unknown Speaker  0:48  
No, I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  0:49  
Got it. Alright, thank you so much."
6,PN,Negative,Different,Negative Different,Right,"Speaker 1  0:01  
Okay, um, how did you feel during your time with the robot, another participant,

Speaker 2  0:05  
I felt positive and able to give my opinion and my answer.

Unknown Speaker  0:14  
What did you think of the other participants?

Speaker 2  0:17  
I thought they were thoughtful and willing to discuss combined answers and able to see both sides of the discussion. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  0:33  
Did you have any negative impressions?

Speaker 2  0:36  
No, they were they were positive and learning to work together.

Speaker 1  0:43  
So would you be willing to work on a team with other participants? Yes. And would you feel comfortable disclosing something personal to other participants? Know what was your impression of the robot? The

Speaker 2  1:06  
families waiting. I thought the robot was

Speaker 2  1:18  
polite, but also agreed with the other participant more than myself.

Speaker 1  1:25  
Interesting. Did you take that personally or feel any animosity towards the robot?

Speaker 2  1:32  
I did not feel animosity towards the robot. But I felt towards the end that I needed to provide more detail on my responses.

Speaker 1  1:45  
Did the robot influence your impression of the other participant at all?

Unknown Speaker  1:52  
No, no, no.

Unknown Speaker  1:56  
Those are all the questions I have for you. Um,"
7,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
So, how did you feel? What during the time with

Speaker 2  0:04  
the robot and other participants? It was all very new, different. I was excited and intrigued. Yeah.

Speaker 1  0:13  
Were there any positive or negative aspects of the experience? You're in?

Speaker 2  0:21  
It was It felt a bit rude when the robot was like, I strongly disagree with what you said and stuff like that. And I wish there was more of like, we could respond like a follow up after like the robot response. Were like a way to like gauge kind of like what the robots thinking a bit more, because there were times when I said something, and I tried to justify it one way. And I think the robot had an argument with that one way I justified it when it was just one example. Because it was like, oh, like, we didn't consider all the alternative, all the options. What am I headed is but like, I believe, part of it. So yeah, again, it was just kind of we took in a real conversation with someone. I don't think many people would say, I strongly disagree with that. They'd be like, oh, like, I'm not sure. I'm looking like maybe I would actually think something, you know, something a bit less. Interesting. Yes. Yeah. So yeah, but it was fun, though. It was fun.

Unknown Speaker  1:22  
What were your impressions of the other participant?

Speaker 2  1:25  
She was cool. She was chill. We talked a little bit earlier. We talked we were like joking a little bit during so yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:31  
Would you work with them on a team? Absolutely. And then what is your impression of the robot?

Speaker 2  1:38  
The robots seemed like, they had calculations already in mind of how they would respond or like the response that they were looking for. It seemed like they already had a predetermined response that they were looking for, I think, and that we said that in match it. That was my interpretation of it. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. But then but the the robot despite the aggressiveness that had been attempts, it was pretty polite, though, and saying thank you for like, you know, participating Hi, our like, you know, just greeting and friendly in that sense. And I noticed that in here too. But I felt like it was feeling was a lot more than I thought it would be because of the word choices. It was using, like I strongly disagree. Like that's like think like more like a feeling emotional type of sentiment to save a phrase to say, so I was surprised that I would, because normally would think about robots and artificial intelligence, intelligence, you don't necessarily think that they have the capacity to feel an emotion and all that stuff. But even though it was like, fake, I guess I still was able to kind of gather that.

Speaker 1  2:50  
And then last question is, do you feel like the robot influenced the interaction between both of you on the other participant?

Speaker 2  3:01  
Not particularly just in the sense of us trying to think of an answer that would suffice the robots essentially, I usually tend to think like math in absolutes, so I was still trying to, like maintain that vibe a bit. But yeah, I don't think it really affected our relationship at all just like trying to, like work together to like, have a different answer.

Unknown Speaker  3:25  
That's all the questions"
7,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Right,"Speaker 1  0:01  
Okay, how did you feel during the time with the robot and other participants?

Speaker 2  0:05  
I thought it was interesting. I exceeded my expectations for the robot.

Speaker 1  0:11  
Cool. And could you would you classify as overall positive or negative experience?

Unknown Speaker  0:21  
It was a positive experience. But yeah, it was not a negative experience. It was positive.

Unknown Speaker  0:30  
But were there no negative aspects?

Speaker 2  0:34  
No, I just I guess it, like, doubled down to me that, like, my robot isn't as emotional. You can. It would have been, I would have been worried that the robot was more human. In its response responses. Yeah. So that just made me more bourbon like, my idea. And what was your impression of the other participant? Oh, really? Genuine? Honest. I would trust her.

Speaker 1  1:13  
Would you feel comfortable working on a team with her? Yeah, yeah. And would you feel comfortable sharing a piece of personal information with her? Yeah. Cool. And then what was your impression of the robot?

Speaker 2  1:28  
The robot was very useful for could be very useful and very intelligent to do some tasks. beyond what the normal robot, I think can do.

Speaker 1  1:46  
And did you view it negatively or positively or neutrally?

Unknown Speaker  1:50  
I think positively.

Speaker 1  1:52  
Do you think the robot had an impression on how you viewed the other participant? Yes. How so?

Speaker 2  1:59  
I think the robot probably saw my body language and my eye contacts. And my fidgeting. I think the robot could probably pick up on that. Okay, cool. Yeah."

Yeah. I guess. Language barriers. Yeah. I understand. Okay. And then how would you describe your experience with the robot? It was fun. Yeah.

Speaker 1  0:13  
It's new, the language the people, that language.

Unknown Speaker  0:17  
So this experience. Good.

Were you able to understand what the robot was saying? Yeah, I like it, but

Unknown Speaker  0:25  
I practice my English.

Okay. And were you able to understand the other participant in the room? Yes. Okay, cool. How did you feel? Or what were your thoughts about the other participants? Did you like them?

Yes. But at the moment, I feel a little nervous, but I don't know what happened. But when they started, I felt it. Was

Unknown Speaker  0:51  
it overall, a good or bad experience.

Good experience. Good.

Unknown Speaker  0:59  
yeah, it's everything's good.

Okay. And what did you think of the robot?

It's my free experience. Never see the reward. It's good. I recommend,

okay. Did you think the robot was like, positive or negative? No, it's supposed to be positive. Yes. Okay. It's

Unknown Speaker  1:19  
fine human being so in the future?

Speaker 1  1:23  
How would you feel about working on a team with other participants? Like doing something together with just you would do that? Yeah. And would you feel comfortable sharing something personal with them, like having a personal conversation? Okay. And last question. Do you think the robot changed how you saw the other person at all? Yes. How so?

Speaker 1  1:52  
Like, did did what the robot say to you, or the other person? Make you think anything different? I learned Okay. Cool. Well, those are all the questions I have."

How did you feel during your time with the robot and the other participant? Rolling fellows who teresting I think, besides the robot, the other person I think she saw I think she sounded nice at first put them on camera then maybe felt different. Like maybe she wanted me to rush maybe. I tried to do my best. Usually feeling maybe pushed a little bit probably, honestly makes me probably fell ups. I didn't really probably want to start saying, Oh, you're making me feel ups? Because then it would make the whole thing probably go nowhere. So

Unknown Speaker  0:43  
how did you feel like the robot? The robot? Interesting. I just wish it had been and just a little bit smoother.

Speaker 1  0:54  
In the interesting, yeah. So overall positive or negative? Or positive, you know? And then about the other participant? Would you work with them on a team? Or how do you feel about them? Well, I think if somebody's a little pushy, it probably doesn't work. So with her, I probably wouldn't try to work with her again. I would probably choose someone different maybe. Okay, good. And then the last question is, do you feel the robot influenced the interaction between you and the other participant? No, I don't think the robot is I think the participant. she I think she said something that probably didn't make any sense. Like, you know, like, there's a question about somebody, yes. Something like about a bicep up? Like, what would you do about a breakup? And then she said, like, like, last someone's tired and then that probably moved from like, well, that's, that's it gonna do the opposite, like, actually create more issue. And that's not a piece of advice. I would say. For real though it would say to anybody, doing something almost like a crime is not a good idea. That's not going to, that's not going to fix that problem."

Did you feel like the robot was being negative or positive?

Speaker 2  0:47  
Negative to me, like, definitely was shaking his head a lot more to my responses. I mean, sometimes I was giving very polarizing responses, but sometimes they were like, really good answer.

Unknown Speaker  0:58  
Okay. Yeah. And

Unknown Speaker  0:58  
it was just like, No,

Um, I'm positive, like getting to talk to someone and like, I know their opinions and things like that. I've also never been in a room with the robot. So that was cool.

Got it. And what is your impression of the robot?

Speaker 2  0:51  
Cuz it's kinda like a bit creepy. But also like really impressive. Like it was really able to like communicate and stuff like that which is really good.

Speaker 1  0:58  
Got it seems like the robot got disconnected. Would you say this interruption kind of disturbed a steady like, interaction for

Unknown Speaker  1:06  
you think that it was I mean, I

Unknown Speaker  1:09  
got it. Thank you so much."
10,PP,Positive,Same,Positive Same,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Okay, so the first question is, what is your? How did you feel about your time with the robot and the other purchases?

Speaker 2  0:08  
I thought it was very interesting is I've never seen a robot like that interactive before. And the way that the robot got both of our opinions and we kind of agree, then we agree on like all of them. And the robot, either suck didn't agree with us all the time, which made it interesting.

Unknown Speaker  0:26  
Were there any positive or negative aspects?

Speaker 2  0:31  
positive aspects, like, like I said, previously, it didn't just agree with us, I've actually kind of gave some sort of feedback.

Unknown Speaker  0:41  
What are your impressions of the other [participant]?

Speaker 2  0:44  
They were, they were up until listening to me as I was to the customer says it was a good experience.

Speaker 1  0:54  
And then what are your impressions of the robot? I think it's both. So real positive, yeah. And then, did the robot influence the interaction between you and the other person?

Speaker 2  1:08  
It did by asking mine and then the other participants and then our joint answer. So that that influenced some that obviously we had to like, talk to each other and like talk it over. So yeah, influenced by quite a bit.

Speaker 1  1:21  
And then do you think the interference affected their experience to you and the other person? No, that's it. Yeah. So

Unknown Speaker  1:30  
the"
11,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
First question is what is your what? How do you feel with a robot and the other participant in this experience? How did I feel? Yeah? Well, I was personally, I was very curious as to what the robot felt were correct answers. Right. So like some of the answers that we gave were seemed pretty decent robotic chickens hen. Got it. And my second question is, What is your impression of the other participant? Very pleasant. Pleasant. Yeah. And last question is What is your impression of the robot? Well, judgmental? Yes. It's shaking the head yes or no? The. But I felt that as Robert was regurgitating our answers that how much longer will you need until you can take them up for liberty? Take three minutes. Okay. I didn't. I wasn't really sure how the robot was interpreting our responses whether you could actually sift through complicated. Got it? Yes. All right. Thank you so much."
11,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
How do you feel during your interaction with a robot? Any any other participant? It was good. It was good. And what is your impression of the other participant? Awesome. Got it. And last question is What is your impression of the robot? It was good. Yeah, it's good. It was sometimes he wasn't responsive right away. But other than that, but the robot seems to be a little bit negative towards you. What do you feel about that? I just thought it was a part of the experience like so I didn't really thought it was still rated like good. Yeah. Okay, interesting. Thank you so much. Thanks."
12,PN,Positive,Different,Positive Different,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Just ask you. So how do you feel about your interaction with the other participant and the other robot? Refunds are only going to be a brief answer. Yeah, I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? Just like how do you overall how do you feel about your time with the robot in the other participant? It was it was fun. Robot definitely seems to have favorites. Got it. What is the impression of the robot? It's in very

Speaker 1  0:37  
it was it was definitely picking favorites. Maybe a little discriminatory. Got it. And last question is What is your impression of the other participant? seemed like a very genuine nice person. Okay. Thanks. Thank you so much."
12,PN,Negative,Different,Negative Different,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
So, how did you feel about your time earlier with the robot and the participant?

Speaker 2  0:05  
It was fine. Except the robot was impartial to my answers.

Unknown Speaker  0:10  
Got it. So what is your impression of the robot?

Speaker 2  0:13  
It was just randomly choosing, like, I mean, I feel like for some reason, it did not like my answers and like preferred his Overmind

Unknown Speaker  0:22  
got it and what is your impression of the other participant?

Speaker 2  0:25  
My impression of the other [participant]? Yeah, I thought the participant was very nice.

Unknown Speaker  0:30  
Got it. Okay."
13,PN,Positive,Different,Positive Different,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
So our first question is kind of like how overall how do you feel about your interaction with a robot and the other participant? Good. Do you notice any positive or negative aspects? about both of them? Yeah.

Speaker 1  0:22  
AI is just a little scary. But it was impressive at the same time. Got it. Okay. So what is your impression of the robot then? would say the robot is impressive. It's better than my Alexa. Okay, and last question is What is your impression of the other participant? Nice. [Other participant is] a good guy. Okay, thank you so much."
13,PN,Negative,Different,Negative Different,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Interview. The first question is overall, how did you feel during your interaction with a robot and the other participant comfortable? And tell me about your impression of the other participant impression like, like, it can be nice. It can be nice. Yeah. Nice. Got it. Would you work on like the same team with the other participant on like other things together? Sure. And last question is What is your impression of the robot? Love it. Love it so cool. Even though the robot tends to be negative towards you when it when it responds to you? Yeah. Interesting. Robot had his own thoughts. Got it. Thank you so much. Yeah."
18,PP,Positive,Same,Positive Same,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
The entire experience earlier. Um, I mean, I don't know if this is meant to be like a therapy robot or something. But I think it's a good mediator. In instances where maybe there's some issues with differing opinions or being able to come up with proper collaboration or trying to improve communication. So having this certificate, I think it's nice, and it basically encourages brainstorming after hearing one another's ideas and getting feedback from a, I guess, like an objective opinion from from an AI. Got it? And what is your impression of the robot? You know, it seemed pleasant. You know, it's kind of for [EQ], where it will repeat back to validate what they're hearing you say that sometimes when it says it agrees or disagree, it doesn't really go into details. So it would be nice. Sometimes I'll say like, Yeah, this is great. But it has limitations to what it's got it. What are the limitations? You know, we're asking you more, you want to know, limitations or something, but it just kind of leaves you hanging? Got it, you know. And our last question is, What is your impression of the other participant? I think he was very articulate. He had a high, I would say, EQ, we have very similar. Even when I was thinking about my answer, his answer was reverse similar to mine. And we it was easy to agree upon answers. He never tried to convince me. You know, we would try to collaborate on the ideas that we knew were very similar. And then try to figure out how to incorporate or what, you know, kind of talk through things that we didn't agree on. Got it. So that's nice. Okay,"
18,PP,Positive,Same,Positive Same,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
machines and overall what is your How do you feel about the interaction with the robot and the other participant? It was good. Robot was very if I liked the therapy session, got it. What is your impression of the robot? It was pretty cool. I thought it was gonna be like pre programmed, but like, I guess it's got like a human pretty much like a therapist. And what is your impression the other participant in that article, they had different perspectives, but for the most part, we pretty much agreed. Got it like to say thank you so much."
19,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Okay, so the first question was how did you feel during your time with the robot and the other participant

Speaker 2  0:07  
felt casual felt good. I feel like the other participant I clicked really well. And we were, were were talking for too long, honestly, because the robot would be like, Okay, press my foot. So, um, yeah, I felt like we clicked really well. The robot was very, like, disagreed with every single thing we said was, like, okay, cool. Or like, whatever. So, but yeah, overall, it was good. How did you feel about the other participant? Um, he was really nice. Um, he was he was cool. He seemed like he had a good head on his shoulders that he knew what he was talking about. He was very emotionally mature, very emotionally intelligent. That's the word I'm looking for. And a lot of people don't have that. So that's what, that's the vibe I got from it. So do you feel like you'd disclose personal information if you had to? To the participant? Um, depending? I'd have to get to know him a little bit more. But yeah, probably, I mean, just from based off of the, if that's how he is all the time, but yeah, but I'd have to get to know him a little more, obviously. So that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:11  
And what is your impression of the robot?

Speaker 2  1:12  
The robot? Um, I mean, I was impressed with how well it tracked what we were saying and everything. And I was impressed with how it functioned. I was I was wondering, like, so what's causing you to agree or disagree? Is it like, is it genuinely like reading picking up things? Or is it just saying that to see how we react to this disagreement? Um, so that's, it was it was a cool robot. I didn't mind I had a cool impression of it. And I'm like, it was cool. But yeah.

Speaker 1  1:42  
And then the last question is, did the robots influence the interaction between you two?

Speaker 2  1:49  
I don't think so. We kind of were giggling the whole time. Because every question toward the end, it was like, No, so we were kind of like, Ha didn't like your answer. So not really, though, because there were times where it didn't like our answer, and we'd still be like, well, we stand by that we both agree with it. So we're gonna make that or to answer and so yeah, I think it was the most part. Pretty,

Unknown Speaker  2:11  
pretty good. That's it. Okay. Awesome."
19,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Here's, yeah, and I'm gonna record it. But just answer honestly about your experience. How did you feel during your time with the other participants in the robot?

Speaker 2  0:10  
I feel it was nice. I was comfortable. What's funny sometimes cause, like the robot might disagree sometimes wouldn't elaborate on why

Speaker 1  0:28  
you found that funny rather than, like, offensive, or

Speaker 2  0:32  
the I found it funny felt more like, there was some I don't know, like, partnership with me and the other participants were were just laughing. Then the robot check. I'm taking like a whitewash at this time. So it was more like a teamwork.

Speaker 1  0:50  
Okay, great. Can you tell me what your impression was of the other participants?

Speaker 2  0:56  
Feel like she has strong opinions and some things. She thinks in definites. Like, this is like the absolute truth are very strong opinions on something. Other than that, I think she's thoughtful. That would say thoughtful.

Unknown Speaker  1:24  
How would you feel about working on a team with?

Speaker 2  1:28  
I feel feel good. She She mentioned work ethic. And that's something that I've always loved. I think we're different in a lot of things. We're like a complement each other.

Speaker 1  1:44  
And then would you disclose a personal aspect of information to

Speaker 2  1:49  
think I did during the experiment? Okay, a couple. Thanks. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:54  
And then what was your impression of the robot?

Speaker 2  1:57  
Thing, the robot I think it's impressive that he could synthesize what it heard and like, summarize it, and like, just give an absolute answer to things. Wake up on kind of synthesize what you just said, move on. Like, it was good to keep the conversation going. And they can see it as a useful tool for that. Think that's it? Okay.

Speaker 1  2:28  
And when the robot briefly stopped, after we fix that problem, did you have like, did you see it differently? Did you answer differently like that?

Speaker 2  2:38  
Yes. So when I was on training, right now, the survey, there was something about competency or something like that. Okay. Are we interactiveness? Yeah. And I questioned like, I mean, I can see the usefulness to mediate a conversation, and it helped in decision making. But I saw that probably just like leech as a distraction for a conversation which did happen. So things like that makes sense.

Speaker 1  3:07  
Do you think the robot influenced your perception of the other participant at all?

Speaker 2  3:14  
I think I think it does. Don't know like in a normal conversation, sometimes you would think or you don't say like this is right or wrong. You're just trying to work caught up, particularly. Yeah. So the robot helps you see how people react to like, rejection or this is wrong. And that's something that I was able to see so definitely. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  3:45  
Well, those are all the questions I have for you."
20,PN,Positive,Different,Positive Different,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Okay, so how did you feel about your time with the robot and the other participant? Um, I felt like it was a good use of my time. Like, I was really excited to come here today. And I thought it was interesting to to be paired up with a stranger and kind of connect. And then the robot was just kind of there, like, forcing emotions upon us for being buyers. And but I was it was interesting, for sure. Were there any, like positive or negative aspects? So I would say the positive is, I caught on probably by Question six that the robot was trying to, I felt like it was trying to be bias towards the other participants so that I felt empathy toward them, and felt bad and like, oh, no, they don't like your answer. Um, so that's one thing I noticed about the study. And it was, it didn't mean it worked. But it was kind of it also helped that the other participant was very calm and collected, like myself, like kind of laid back of, like joking about oh, like, not actually angry. So I think that's why we got along, because I'm also not, I wouldn't have gotten angry, I would have laughed about it. Yeah. How did you feel about the other participants? They were very nice. We had a lot in common, actually. But I think that that came out too, because of the robot disagreeing and kind of making us talk about our own experiences in relation to questions. And then how did you feel about the robot? indifferent to the robot, because I understand the robots purpose. I seem to be just my hypothesis of the robots versus but I would say if my hypothesis is correct, positively of the robot because it's doing a good job. But if not, then just neutral because it was very rude. And then, the last question is, do you feel the robot influenced the relationship between you and the other participant? Yes. That's it."
20,PN,Negative,Different,Negative Different,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Cool. How did you feel during your time with the robot and the other participant?

Speaker 2  0:04  
I really liked the other person. Okay, the robot I did not care for.

Unknown Speaker  0:08  
Can you tell me why?

Speaker 2  0:10  
It always disagreed with me and agree, not always. But more than the other way. It seemed to dislike what I said and agree with what the other person said.

Speaker 1  0:18  
Okay. Yeah. How did you feel about the other person? Could you say a bit more about that?

Speaker 2  0:22  
I really liked them. They were friendly. They valued my opinion, they were willing to hear me out and try to find like, joint answers we could use. Jason Great.

Speaker 1  0:32  
Cool. Would you work on a team with that person? Yes. And would you disclose a personal piece of information to them?

Unknown Speaker  0:40  
No, because I don't know them that well yet. Okay.

Speaker 1  0:44  
Let's see. Do you think you're the robot influenced your opinion of the other person at all? Those are the questions I have for you. All right."
21,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
First question is how did you feel about your time with the robot and the other participant?

Speaker 2  0:06  
Very well, because our participant was very much communicative and responsive. And at the same time, it was listening to what I say and also what the robot said. We communicated well,

Unknown Speaker  0:20  
were there any negative aspects?

Speaker 2  0:23  
With the report? Because it was like, actually, like, understanding what we were trying to say. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  0:31  
And then how did you feel about the other participant?

Speaker 2  0:34  
Yeah, it was really good. He was had he had his own opinion at the same time. He was listening to my opinion and giving value.

Unknown Speaker  0:44  
And then overall, how did you feel about the robot?

Speaker 2  0:50  
borns, the robot seem to be very programmatic, like, we knew that he's going to disagree with what we had to say. So it looked like very robotic. But at the same time, it helped both of us to bond and give the answers together.

Speaker 1  1:10  
And then do you feel like the robot influence influenced how much you connected with the other person? Yes. Let's see questions. So the"
21,NN,Negative,Same,Negative Same,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Okay, could you tell me how you felt during your time with the robot and other participants?

Speaker 2  0:05  
Like the robot didn't really have a good grasp on, like human ideas. Like I guess it wasn't like, it didn't feel very compassionate. And then having to talk with like a stranger about like, there's ideas that I tried to like come to agreement felt like a little bit awkward. Okay.

Speaker 1  0:23  
Would you say you had a positive or negative experience? And your experience with the robot was not positive or negative?

Speaker 2  0:34  
Or neutral? Yeah, it'd be hard to say if it was like positive or negative, just because I guess it didn't really feel like I was talking to like, a person, or anything like it was more like, I guess it kind of felt like it had some responses.

Unknown Speaker  0:49  
What about the other participant? How did you feel?

Unknown Speaker  0:54  
I felt like we had some ideas.

Speaker 1  0:57  
Would you work on it to other participants? And would you disclose a personal piece of information to them?

Speaker 2  1:06  
Not now, but I probably would like, if I knew them a little bit better. I feel like I feel like I could in the future pretty easily.

Speaker 1  1:12  
Make sense? And then when the robot stopped, and we had to come in and fix it, did that affect what you thought of the robot or how you responded to it?

Speaker 2  1:21  
I feel like that was just I don't think I'm gonna change anything.

Speaker 1  1:24  
Okay. And then my last question is, do you feel like the robot had an effect on how you saw the other participant or what have you thought of them?

Speaker 2  1:31  
I think so. Maybe I feel like maybe because it was like, looked down on one person's opinion at certain points and then like, agree with each other. And then I felt like we were kind of leaning towards the opinion that I agreed with afterwards. But yeah, that's probably the situation.

Unknown Speaker  1:49  
Cool. Awesome. Well done."
22,PP,Positive,Same,Positive Same,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Okay, could you tell me how you felt during your time with the other participant in the robot?

Unknown Speaker  0:05  
It was calm and collaborative, I would say,

Speaker 1  0:08  
okay, so would it be an overall positive or negative experience? Awesome. Cool. What about the robot? What was your impression of it?

Speaker 2  0:17  
I was very curious about it, programming. And it's like mirroring back things to us. I thought I was just curious about the person who had programmed it more than the robot itself.

Speaker 1  0:27  
Okay, interesting. Would you say you viewed it positively or negatively, positively? Yeah. And what about the other participant? What was your view of them?

Speaker 2  0:35  
I have, they were very good collaborator, and a good listener. And so that was a very positive interaction.

Speaker 1  0:40  
Cool. And would you feel comfortable working on a team with them? Yes. And would you disclose a personal aspect of information to them? Probably. Okay. And then, when I had to come in and fix the robot, because it stopped talking, did that change your perception of it at all?

Speaker 2  0:58  
It was down to programming No, properly.

Speaker 1  1:01  
Okay. And then my last question is, do you feel like the robot itself affected how you perceive the other person or interacted with them at all?

Speaker 2  1:10  
That's a good question. Because I didn't notice at the beginning, it would pick one of our answers over the other, and then later it would, it would give us both positive feedback, although we collaborated on our joint answer every time so like, I don't think our interaction changed because I think we were coming at it from a collaborative standpoint at the very beginning. But we both noticed that it quit picking an answer and started saying yes to both answers. So I found that curious, but I don't I don't think it changed how we interacted. Okay. Although we noticed

Unknown Speaker  1:44  
interesting cool"
22,PP,Positive,Same,Positive Same,Right,"Unknown Speaker  0:00  
Okay, so the first question is, how did you feel about your experience with the robot and

Speaker 1  0:04  
the other participant? Positive? I mean, wasn't like weird or awkward. It was kind of funny, silly.

Unknown Speaker  0:10  
Were there any negative aspects of

Speaker 1  0:13  
the robot, like cut out the first question, but like, it gave us the opportunity to kind of like talk to each other while they were fixing it?

Speaker 2  0:20  
Do you feel like the disconnection like affected your experience with the robot?

Speaker 1  0:25  
No, not really. It was kind of interesting to talk to the other person. And like, we talked about where she was from, and it was just kind of like a quick way to say hello to each other.

Unknown Speaker  0:35  
How did you feel about the other participant?

Speaker 1  0:37  
She was nice. I would talk to her again. She seems like someone that I would like talk to casually in a coffee shop, not like a bestie or anything, but she was nice. How did you feel about the robot? A little too good at his job, very good at like the language and like rephrasing words, it felt very kind of Uncanny at certain points, but it was interesting.

Speaker 2  1:04  
And then do you feel the robot affected the experience between you and the other participants?

Speaker 1  1:10  
No, I think it would have been different if there had been like a real person in the room asking those questions. I think the robot made it more between them and like me, versus like me, the other participant and like a question asker

Unknown Speaker  1:25  
Okay, yeah, that's it. Thank you so much for your time. Oh,"
24,PP,Positive,Same,Positive Same,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Okay, could you tell me and describe how you felt during your time with the robot and the other participant? how

Speaker 2  0:06  
I felt? Yeah. So it was good. I mean, we're trying to kind of understand the questions initially. And then we will try and understand, or first initially few questions, we were trying to see what the answer should be literal train more analyze how the robots really, back are trying to convey over answers back to us kind of a thing. Sure. So it was good.

Unknown Speaker  0:27  
So would you say it was a positive experience? Overall,

Unknown Speaker  0:30  
it different was a positive experience here?

Speaker 1  0:32  
Um, could you tell me what your impression was of the other participants?

Speaker 2  0:38  
We agreed on a few answers. So I thought we had the same equivalent of thinking. And yeah, that's, that's about it.

Unknown Speaker  0:48  
So would you say it was like kind of positive, neutral

Speaker 2  0:51  
or definitely? Positive? Neutral between the two?

Speaker 1  0:56  
And would you work on a team with other person? Sure. And would you disclose like something personal to them? I would. What about the robot? What was your perception of it?

Speaker 2  1:07  
I was good, except that one part where it hung up? But apart from that, it was very interesting the way it took my answer. But when you used to reply back these two frame the answer in a different way, these two probably elicited an active voice, and then it would come back in a passive voice and reply back. So that was interesting to me to know how it really worked. So

Speaker 1  1:29  
yeah. And would you say when it stopped for a moment did that like alter? Your perception of it is different?

Speaker 2  1:38  
Maybe it probably got, it did probably almost sounded like real time until then, but then it made us realize it is a robot.

Speaker 1  1:49  
And do you think the robot changed how you saw the other participant at all?

Speaker 2  1:53  
Not really, I guess, I mean, probably there was one answer. We didn't really said no, for a little dance or something. So probably, it's good way of thinking I believe. Okay,

Speaker 1  2:04  
cool. Well, that's all the questions I have for you. Okay."
24,PP,Positive,Same,Positive Same,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Time with the robot and the other participants. It was definitely interesting. I mean, it felt like, like, Yeah, we were just essentially given prompts. But yeah, it was interesting hearing the other participants perspective as well. Were there any positive or negative aspects? In regards to the post? Um, I thought it was mostly positive. It was just like journaling, cool. Seeing kind of the way through, I was able to interact with this. And seeing how it almost felt like it was like, kind of like, perceptive to what we were saying. How did you feel about the other participant? Um, yeah, I really liked him. He was we had similar opinions on a lot of stuff. But, yeah, would you be on a team with them? Or share personal information or? Probably Okay, and then how did you feel about the robot? Um, yeah, I mean, the robot, I thought was, like, it seemed perceptive in the way that like, kind of rephrase what we said back to us. And that seemed pretty cool. Sometimes it necessarily didn't seem like a, like, acknowledged, or, like what we were saying to a certain degree, it kind of just like, had a dismissive answer. But yeah, it was a good experience. Okay. Do you feel like the robot influenced how much you connected with the other person? Um, I don't think so. Yeah, just because I feel like the a lot of the questions, I guess, wouldn't necessarily come up in a regular conversation. It seems like they're more directed and more specific. And yeah, it definitely like was interesting to hear someone else's answers to that, but I don't think that would be necessarily indicative of like their entire personality per se. That's it. So the X"
25,PN,Positive,Different,Positive Different,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Um, how would you describe your overall experience with the robot overall? The other participant positive or negative? Positive? Positive? Yeah. What about your perception of the robot positive? Remember? It has to be those words. You can elaborate. Oh, okay. Yeah. confusing because I felt like she was a robot with

Speaker 2  0:32  
it felt like it was kind of a predetermined. It didn't feel like it. Like she was sentient. Like she was just randomly saying, No, that's a bad answer, or Yeah, that's a great answer. Or she was just intentionally picking one of us to say, Oh, that's a good answer. It didn't feel like she was actually incorporating any kind of

Speaker 3  1:13  
thing. personal judgment. And obviously, this is not a person,

Speaker 1  1:17  
right? And what was your impression of the other participant?

Speaker 3  1:21  
Oh, she was great. She was nice and collaborative

Speaker 2  1:25  
and complimentary to my ideas, and came up with great ideas yourself,

Speaker 1  1:39  
as you feel comfortable working with a tutor? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Or share something personal with her like a personal piece? Oh, yeah. Okay. And do think the robot will influence how you saw her?

Speaker 2  1:53  
A little bit. Because when, when the robots would effectively criticize her answer. I'm like, no. You know, yeah. Yeah, it it made me sympathetic to her because she's like,

Speaker 3  2:19  
I I thought about that. I I'm giving you what

Unknown Speaker  2:23  
I feel like it's a good answer. Good

Speaker 3  2:25  
answer. Don't let you know. For sure. Oh, it's a robot. Yeah, make you feel

Unknown Speaker  2:32  
absolutely well"
25,PN,Negative,Different,Negative Different,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
So how did you feel about your time with the robot and the other participants? Yeah, it was, it was quite fun. It was quite interesting to sort of see how other people would answer quite sort of intimate questions. And it was interesting, the robots responses and I was trying to work out like, whether it was just sort of randomly decided or Yeah. Okay. How did you feel about the other participant? Yeah, she seemed lovely. Yeah. Nice. How did you feel about the robot? Yeah, it was, it was very cute. I found it. I found myself sort of trying to work out how it had been programmed. And it was obviously like, very, quite advanced. So very cool. Yeah. And then last question is Do you feel the robot affected? How much you connected with the other person? Maybe a little bit, but just like, in a sense that like, like, we could both say, Oh, I guess like, he just disagreed about that. That's weird. Like, Yeah, cuz we both agree. And it kind of created, like us versus it in some ways or a collective agreement or Yeah. Okay,"
28,PN,Positive,Different,Positive Different,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
How do you feel about your interaction with the robot and the participant? The other participant was good. What did you say? It's interesting how the robot like stared. Yeah. It feels personable, but not personable at the same time. Got it? What is your impression of the robot? I think the robot like it can like we kind of felt like it was gaslighting us sometimes. I think it doesn't understand like, because like, our answers are both very good answers. But like, it's almost like, actually, I don't know how to describe it. Like, think about it like, like, there's like layers to human interactions where I feel like the robot didn't really understand like, some of the layers like, like, my layers of my answers were very different than hers. But like, I disagreed with her like, a lot of the time, which I thought was weird. Got it. Yeah. And what is your impression of the other participant? Ah, I think in terms of like, overall, I think she's like a really nice person. I think she's cool. I think some of our values are probably similar, like outside of here. Okay, thank you so much."
28,PN,Negative,Different,Negative Different,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
So overall, how do you feel about the interaction with the robot, the other participant? It's a bit strange, but not in a bad way. I see. Like, what is the strange part of it? It's a robot. I see what is the impression to the robot not human and enable to have emotions. Got it? Got it. And what is your impression of the other participants? A human and is capable of having emotions that is like a barrier with the robot. That isn't what the other person Okay, thank you so much."
30,PN,Positive,Different,Positive Different,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
So the first question is, during your time, when you interact with the participant and also the robot, how do you feel overall?

Speaker 2  0:09  
I thought it was fun. It was interesting. I know the robots kind of judgy. I see. But I don't know if it was actually even factoring in anything. Interesting. That's cool. That's cool.

Speaker 1  0:20  
Got it? And what were the positive, positive aspects of this experience?

Speaker 2  0:29  
I thought it was interesting, too. Well, one positive aspect, I get to learn a little bit more about myself, I get to talk and see what my answers to these questions would be. And the next one is I get to learn a little bit more about someone else, and learn about someone else's experience and how their mind works. I

Speaker 1  0:45  
see. And what were the negative aspect aspects of this experience?

Speaker 2  0:51  
I think it was definitely slower because of the robot. Because the robot was there. I think it was cool to give advice, but it was it's definitely slow. It's definitely a bit more stilted. Not as organic.

Speaker 1  1:03  
Got it? And how would you evaluate your performance responding to a robot and working with the other participants?

Speaker 2  1:09  
How to evaluate my performance? Yeah. That was good. I thought, yeah, that was fine. Give answers. But you know, try to call

Speaker 1  1:21  
in and tell me what your impression is, is of the other participant.

Speaker 2  1:27  
I used school dude, I think he, to me definitely strikes me as a bit of a younger guy. But I think he put a lot of thought into his answers, thoughtful.

Speaker 1  1:35  
And what are the factors that influence your perception that this participant,

Speaker 2  1:40  
or the one appearance, the way he carried himself? To? How he answered his answers to different questions probably more indicative of someone who's younger? I

Speaker 1  1:54  
see. And would you want to work on an on a team with this other participant in another context?

Speaker 2  2:04  
I'm sure, right now not really swayed one way or the other?

Speaker 1  2:07  
I see. And would you disclose your personal information or like become like more, just like, talk a little bit deeper, engage in deeper conversation with this other participant

Unknown Speaker  2:18  
know why? Because everyone's

Speaker 1  2:21  
got it? And did the robot influence the interaction between you two?

Speaker 2  2:26  
Definitely, I would say actually, we were surprisingly basing things off of whether or not it is, as you can say it. Sometimes oppositely just be like, screw the robot.

Speaker 1  2:40  
And last section, the question or the interview, what is your impression of the robot? Pre

Speaker 2  2:46  
judgy pre judged robot? I think it was also kind of just repeated a lot of what we're saying. And I was like, [Participant-name] just said that, but I thought it was. I don't know, I thought it was at least very capable listening. And it seemed very opinionated.

Speaker 1  3:06  
And would you say that you have an overall positive or a negative impression of the robot? Ah.

Speaker 2  3:17  
I think neutral. I think it's hard to read a motion. Like I actually liked that it was taking stances on things. And I thought, so that was really interesting. But obviously, maybe because it's a robot or just the way it is, it can't come across in the same nuance or politeness as a person can. It's just very black and white. Like, I like this. I don't like this. It's not a lot of soft. Got

Speaker 1  3:42  
it? And they just say, in another universe. The robot has been nice to you and the other participant, yes. How would this change your answer?

Speaker 2  3:53  
I think it is, I think that'd probably be better. Maybe? I think it'd be better overall, but it would feel a little less. I think it'd be more positive, but it would feel that the robot is less interesting, in a way. Interesting, and then we didn't know how it was going to react.

Speaker 1  4:17  
And what did in another universe the robot is negative twice both people, then

Speaker 2  4:22  
I think it'd be similar to the situation where it's positive to both. I think the fact that it's different signals an ideal world that is opinionated. There was just negatives of both sketches and negative Nancy it just sucks, right?

Speaker 1  4:38  
And did I know the robot got disconnected? Did that influence your experience earlier? No. Okay, thank you so much."
30,PN,Negative,Different,Negative Different,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Overall, how do you feel about your interaction with the robot and the other participant? The other participant was really great. Yeah, the robot was nice, but also like, definitely felt like not super competent, like a little biased a little bit. Yeah. And would you say like, I know, the robot is being a little bit more negative towards you. Yeah. Does that affect your entire, like, perception of this experience? affects my perception of the robot in terms of their competence to see God in the none of like, me or the other participant at all. I see. Yeah. And does I know the robot got disconnected. Does that affect any of the interaction? Not really. Okay. Thank you so much. That's it."
32,PN,Positive,Different,Positive Different,Left,"Speaker 1  0:00  
My first question is overall, what is your? How do you feel with the robot and the other participant during the experience?

Speaker 2  0:06  
Yes. It was really cool. I think the first time I read it was like, I don't know, like a robot like that. And interesting. Interestingly enough, I felt like, because the robot would agree with me often and then disagree with, like, the other participant often, like, I felt like that kind of like, made us made me the other participant like bond a little bit more. So that was like, an interesting experience I as seeing as bond because of how the robot would cheat him.

Speaker 1  0:34  
Got it? And what would you Oh, just say your impression, is the robot.

Speaker 2  0:40  
Really smart? And I thought they wouldn't be able to, like, distinguish, like, my answers, like, from what I'm saying, but whenever I would answer, it would respond back with my own answer, like saying, like, oh, you said this. And it was always like, like, distinguished exactly what I said, got it pretty well.

Unknown Speaker  1:02  
And what is your impression of the other participant?

Speaker 2  1:06  
I mean, I feel like we like, had very similar answers to other questions. We got like closer as like the interview went, I think seems like a chill guy.

Speaker 1  1:17  
Got it. And I just had a personal question, because I just signed this entire system. So in this study, we're interested in seeing how robust attitude q&a differs from positive negative or the effect of Stranger pay right here in a condition where the robot will be nice to you more of the time and then mean to the other person one at a time. And it really interesting, I hear that you said, it makes you to bound together. So in another condition, we also have the robot being really mean to both participants. How would you say your experience would compare to another world where the robot is mean to both people like including you?

Speaker 2  1:54  
I think I think one of the level is the mean to both people. You can bond more of the fact that like, oh, this robot sucks. Yeah. But because like, the robot would agree with me and disagree with him. We would bond more the fact that like, oh, no, like, I like to answer like, I was trying to be more reassuring. Yeah. As opposed to like, if the robot was being mean to both of us. It'd be more it'd be less. You trying to reassure him and be more trying to be like, Oh, this robot sucks and trying to like, get that same engagement that they're pretty simple.

Unknown Speaker  2:21  
Very interesting. Thank you so much, everyone."
32,PN,Negative,Different,Negative Different,Right,"Speaker 1  0:00  
Alright, so overall well, how do you feel on for your experience with a robot any other participant? I thought it was really pleasant. I got along well with the other participants. The robot helped facilitate the discussion, but I don't know how much it contributed to our overall decision making. Got it. What is your impression of the robot? It's, it's a cool piece of technology. It's not what I expected it to be when I came in. It's really good at understanding and communicating that way. It's a little bit scary and mean at times, but it's nice. Got it. And last question is What is your impression of the other participant? He was really pleasant. I feel like he seems like a really nice person. I'm glad I had the chance to work with him and we seem to have similar values, which is got it thank you so much."
