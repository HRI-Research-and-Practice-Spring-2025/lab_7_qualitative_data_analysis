# lab_7_qualitative_data_analysis

This repository contains the starter code for [Lab 07: Qualitative Data Analysis](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2025/spring/20630-1/lab_07_qualitative_data_analysis.html) for the University of Chicago course [CMSC 20630/30630 Human-Robot Interaction: Research and Practice](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2025/spring/20630-1/index.html) taught by Dr. Sarah Sebo in Spring 2025. 

The learning goals for this lab are:
- Students will earn how to collaboratively perform a thematic analysis on interview transcripts.
- Students will gain experience implementing the steps for open/axial coding, codebook development, and inter-coder reliability testing.
- Students will gain practical experience using coding as a tool for identifying patterns in human-robot interaction (HRI) research data.
